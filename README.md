Idea Desciption: 
 
Building a Peer-to-peer (P2P) insurance platform that allows a group of insureds to pool their capital, self-organize, and self-administer their own insurance. The core idea of P2P is that a set of like-minded people with mutual interests group their insurance policies together introducing a sense of control, trust, and transparency while at the same time reducing costs. This model of insurance combines traditional pooling and sharing of losses in a decentralized way, providing a product for increasingly savvy consumers who require transparency in an on-demand economy. 

Main Workflows in nutshell:

Create/Join Pools

  1- The user can ask to join an exiting pool or create a new pool
  
  2- The user accepts the pool terms and conditions defined by the pool creator/manager
  
  3- The user pay the anuual premuim to join that pool and becomes a member
  
  4- The premiums are transfered and locked into an escrew account 
  
  5- The insurance policy is activated once all the conditions are met
  
Request Claims

  1- A pool member can submit a claim in case of occured incident
  
  2- The platform checks the validity of request offchain
  
  3- There could be a voting mechanism (member consenus) to approve clains
  
  4- The insured will be received the requested amount in his own wallet
  
 Excess in pool Coverage
 
   1- The pool could have a re-insurer in case if there is an excess in pool coverage
   
   2- The re-insurer manage the members' claims wherein the total claim amount exceeds the contribution
   
   3- part of premium/contribution is shared with reinsurers
   
  Refund the surplus
  
    1- At the expiry of pool policy, the remaining money is re-distributed to the members
